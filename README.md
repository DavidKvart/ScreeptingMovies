# Scrapting Movies project

This project is the first project I made while using scrapting methods, I used the puppeteer library and did it on a react app.

## Project design

I made a simple puppeteer file in node.js that took 500  movies from the IMDB website, devided into sections, and saved it in a local variable object
, then I took the variable and builded a react up that displays it, I added some functionality for deleting a movie, like a movie, adding new movies, and a simple pagination
